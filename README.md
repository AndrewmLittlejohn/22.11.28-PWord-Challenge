# 22.11.28-PWord-Challenge


This weeks Challenge was to augment the current HTML and CSS with the neccessary JavaScript to provide a user with a computer generated password. This was to be done using user feedback on the parameters of the password that best suit them, character limit (8-128), Character types ( Upper, Lower, Num, Special). The password is then provided back to the user in the body of the website.

This was my first time writing code where I met the acceptance criteria and know something more efficient and scalable must be out there, but hey got a mvp out the door right, and didn't have time to find the more scalable method. I used a series of if statements.
